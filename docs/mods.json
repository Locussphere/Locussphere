    "detailedDescription": "In Minecraft PvP and PvE, lag often causes Ghost Hits—situations where your client thinks you hit an enemy, plays the sound and particles, but the server rejects it because you were slightly too far away.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nThis Fabric mod acts as a client-side range limiter. It calculates the exact distance to your target before you swing. If the target is further than 3.0 blocks (the standard survival reach), the mod prevents the attack packet from sending.\n\nFeatures:\n• Instant Feedback: If you don't swing, you know you need to move closer.\n• Client-Side Only: Works on any server without needing to be installed on the server.\n• Lightweight: Zero performance impact.\n• Fair Play: Does not increase reach; it only validates it to match vanilla behavior.",

Signal strength is shown as a colour gradient — bright red for full power (15), fading to dark red for weak signals (1). Repeaters show their delay visually, and comparators display their output mode.\n\nThe mod also includes a \"trace\" mode where you can click on any redstone block and it will follow the entire signal path for you, showing you start to finish where your power is going — and where it stops.
